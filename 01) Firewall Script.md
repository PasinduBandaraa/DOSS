As the first task we created new rules in windows firewall. 

In order to do that we logged into local security policy window and created new inbound rule from here.

We can give any port number here and we gave port no.1521 because attackers can perform DoS attacks by sending malicious tcp packets to this port.

Then we allowed all other traffic by creating this rule.
