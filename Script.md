I'm Ranaweera H.N.K. and my registration number is IT20012960.

In this video demonstration, we hope to demonstrate how we implemented the given security checklist to secure our database and Operating system. 

We decided to use windows 10 as our Operating system and Oracle 19c as our database. Addition to that we use Oracle SQL developer to run our queries.

This is the installation process of the database.
